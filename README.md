# Ruby Shell v1.37

A "simple" UNIX shell written in Ruby because why not!

Disclamer: This shell shouldn't be ran with Bundle.



Credits to Stargirl-chan on GitHub for the original Ruby-Shell. This is an unofficial modified fork of it with many added feautres and more. Go check them out, they make awesome stuff, such as cool-tty! Oh and yes, this might be PR'd.

These two sites helped me creating it:
